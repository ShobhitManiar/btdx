To use the `btdx`, you need to create an instance of `DX` first. Then use either `post` method to ingest data or `get` method to retrieve data

1. **Initialization** To create an instance of DX, provide your API key, feed ID, and optionally a version number..
   
   ```python
   from btdx import DX  # Make sure to import the DX class from the module
   api_key = "your_api_key"     # Your API key
   feed_id = "your_feed_id"     # The feed ID you want to interact with
   version = 1                  # Optional: Version number (default is 1)
   response = DX(api_key, feed_id, version)
   ```

2. **Posting Data** You can post data to a specific stream by calling the post method. You need to provide the stream ID and the data you want to post.

    ```python
    stream_id = "100"           # The ID of the stream you want to post data to
    data =  "AQI: 2"         # The value you want to post
    response.post(stream_id=stream_id, data=data)
    ```

3. **Getting Data** To retrieve data from a specific stream, use the get method. You can specify the stream ID and whether you want to display the data. You can also pass optional parameters such as agregate.

    ```python
    stream_id = "100"           # The ID of the stream you want to get data from
    # Retrieve and display data
    response.get(stream_id=stream_id, display=True)
    # Retrieve last 100 values between a date range and display data, if no range is provided last 100 values from current time will be obtained.
    start="YYYY-MM-DD"
    end="YYYY-MM-DD"
    response.get(stream_id=stream_id, start=start, end=end, display=True, agregate=True)
    ```
